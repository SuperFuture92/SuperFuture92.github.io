										<p align="justify">Charles’s passion in Education, especially for the African youth, motivates him to persistently seek opportunities to use technology and promote excellence in Quality Education in Africa. It is widely recognised on the continent that poor education and lack of access to technology are major stumbling blocks to economic competitiveness and social equality.  As feeder subjects for a career in IT, the low quality of maths and science education in Africa is alarming. With this in mind, Charles launched the <b>Young African Technologists (YAT)</b> initiative that is aimed at promoting education through technology in underprivileged African communities. During his 2-year stay in India, he supported African students through the <b>Knowledge Sharing Campaign (KSC)</b> that he founded to empower the African student diaspora and reverse brain drain.</p>

During his stay in Hyderabad, Paulcy was the President of COBSA (Congo Brazzaville Students Association - Hyderabad Chapter), he realised that there is a huge community of African students like him facing three big problems.</p>

													<p align="justify">It is widely recognized in South Africa and on the continent that poor education and lack of access to technology are major stumbling blocks to economic competitiveness and social equality.  As feeder subjects for a career in IT, the low quality of maths and science education in South Africa is alarming. As KSC's Ambassadors, we are always looking for ways to make an impact, to show children and young adults the opportunities that exist in technology, inspiring the next generation of software engineers.</p>

A KSC ambassador should become a world changer, that spreads the example of a platform of collaborative learning experience that crosses disciplines and merges ideas to create new thinking for a new world. The core values of KSC are academic freedom, tolerance, and experimentation. Create a new crop of open minded African leaders who will find solutions to African problems.</p>

													<h4>Left &amp; Right</h4>
													<p align="justify"><span class="image left"><img src="images/02.png" alt="" /></span>The Knowledge Sharing Campaign is a community platform that brings together two groups of people: the Know & Can Teach (those who have experience and can share their knowledge) group and the Don’t Know & Can Learn (those who are eager to learn, but lack opportunities) group. KSC originated from a simple idea, which turned out to be its slogan: 'Bring, Share & Learn'.</p>
													<p align="justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/02.png" alt="" /></span>There are no specific prerequisites to participate in these sessions. In fact, only a few students who attend these sessions have their own laptops. KSC is not just about tech sessions, but about knowledge sharing. Students who come have very limited exposure to key technologies. They first attend the KSC introductory sessions, which focus on assessing and improving the participant's computer literacy. For example, students who study in a non computer science program, create accounts for a list of free online applications and services, like GitHub. Not all students are able to efficiently use technologies like Google Apps that allow them to work as a team on a single report. KSC becomes a bridge that helps students embrace a very large online world, with skills needed to access this.</p>

													<h3>Taking the Knowledge Sharing Campaign to the Next Level</h3>
													<div class="box">
														<p align="justify">KSC participants are skilled in software development and are motivated to embrace technology at large. Students are encouraged to use their learnings to come up with innovative ideas to propose solutions to African problems. This is useful for the development of their communities when they return home. KSC’s mainstream program includes hands-on training workshops, a four-week internship program, entrepreneurship and leadership development seminars, and roundtable discussions.</p>
